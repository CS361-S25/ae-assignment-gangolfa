Artificial Ecologies Assignment

In this assignment, I created a cow and grass organisms that interact on a toridal grid.
The grass grows and the cows step around the grid to eat grass.

Grass organism gains 10 points every step.

Cows lose 10 points every step, but gain 200 points by eating grass
If a cow has less than -1000 points, they will die.

Both organisms can reproduce when they have 1000 points, and then their points reset to 0.

The resulting simulation allows each organism maintains it's population through reproduction and death.
